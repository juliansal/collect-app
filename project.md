# Collect App

Collect will be a simple photo gallery (like Instagram or Pintrest) where the user can save images and data on collectible items. The user can tag items that she intends on adding to the collection or tag items that are already a part of her collection.

## User Stories
As a user, I want to view all the images of my collection gallery.

As a user, I want to click on and image and be taken to the image's profile page.

As a user, I want to tag a item if I 'have it' or 'want it'.

As a user, I want to read a small description of my item.

As an admin, I want to perform CRUD operations from a dashboard.

## Dashboard
- The dashboard area will list out all items in the collection. 
- Each item will have edit and delete button. 
- There will be an add button near the top of the page.
- The add and edit buttons will redirect to pages with forms for adding items to the collection.
- Dashboard views:
    - /dashboard (show)
    - /dashboard/add (create)
    - /dashboard/edit/:id (update)
